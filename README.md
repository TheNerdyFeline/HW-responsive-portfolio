This is a copy of the basic-portfolio with added media-queries.

## Requirements
-- Copy all HTML, CSS, and Images from basic portfolio into to repo and homework file called responsive-porfolio
-- Create media queries for all 3 pages at 640px, 768px, and 980px;

Had to create a responsive website with basic portolfiol. Currently there are some errors I'm running into. In the 640px media the header and footer are not going 100% wide, portfolio ;abels are going over the image when they are both set to 100$ wide, and nav menu is not center and text-align: center; does not work.
On the 740px the header is not 100%wide, and the portfolio mn is not the full height like on the other 2 pages. Then at 960px the header and footer are not 100% wide.  Still working on it and hopefully will find a solution soon.
